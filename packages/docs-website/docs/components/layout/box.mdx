# Box

By using the `BuiBox` component, you can easily control the layout, spacing, and styling of your components in a declarative and intuitive manner. It helps keep your code organized and maintainable while providing a consistent and visually appealing user interface.

It provides a flexible way to create and control layout and spacing within a React application.

Here's an example of how the Box component can be used:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { BuiBox } from '@beyondui/react';

export const UserDetails = ({ children }) => {
    return(
        <BuiBox>
            <h2>John Doe</h2>
            <p>Email: johndoe@example.com</p>
            <p>Location: New York City</p>
        </BuiBox>
    )
};
```
